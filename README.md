A simple site for atypical words: http://word-storm.com

This was a quick personal project I created in order to practice some Frontend Skills.

All the logic is in public/javascript/index.js, there are lots of comments in that file to help you understand what's going on.

20/73 random words are randomly displayed on the page with absolute positioning, with their descriptions appended just below 
the words themselves.  Randomness is fun!

Checkout public/style.css if you'd like to see the css, it's all in basic CSS3.



To get this up and running on your local machine:

- Clone this repository (fork it first if you'd like)

- Navigate into the created repo (cd word-storm.com)

- npm install

- npm start

- Learn a couple fancy sounding words!
